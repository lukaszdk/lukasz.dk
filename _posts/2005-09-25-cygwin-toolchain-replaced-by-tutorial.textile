I havn't updated the Cygwin Toolchain since everything at ps2dev.org got moved from CVS to Subversion. So today I decided to remove the precompiled toolchains from my website and instead write a tutorial on how to compile them yourself. <a href="http://www.lukasz.dk/playstation-2-programming/cygwin-tutorial/">Available here</a> and also linked from the PlayStation 2 Programming section.

I did this mainly because its just as simple to build the toolchain yourself as it was to download it precompiled from my site. The advantage of this solution is that you no longer depend on me updating the chains.
