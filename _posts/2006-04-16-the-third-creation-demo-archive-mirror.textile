One of the great things that came out of homebrew PlayStation 2 development were all the demos entered for The Third Creation, a demo contest without any prizes. Unfortunately, The Third Creation website has been been down for quite some time. Luckily, I had a backup of all the demos and most of the screenshots, so I made a mirror of the demo archive <a href="http://www.lukasz.dk/playstation-2-programming/the-third-creation/">here</a>.
