Due to the <a href="http://lukasz.dk/2006/03/18/cygwin-problems/">problems</a> with building the PS2 toolchains in Cygwin, I have now written a tutorial which explains how to build the PS2 toolchains in <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>, a lightweight GNU enviroment for Windows. The tutorial also provides binaries of the toolchains. Check it out <a href="http://lukasz.dk/playstation-2-programming/mingw-tutorial/">here</a>.

*Update:* The tutorial has been updated with a link to instructions on how to build the toolchains in Windows Vista, provided by chip.

*Update 2:* It appears that the PS2 toolchains, when built in MinGW, do not always generate correct code. If a solution to this problem is found, I will post it here and update the MinGW tutorial. Until then you can follow the progress of overcoming the problem in <a href="http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8568">this thread</a> at the PS2Dev.org forums.

*Update 3:* <span class="name">ragnarok2040</span> has now supplied a patch the PS2 toolchains to fix the code generation bug and the ps2toolchain patches have been updated. Today I've rebuilt the PS2 toolchains for MinGW and uploaded the new binaries. I've tested them and verified that the bug is fixed, great work ragnarok2040!
