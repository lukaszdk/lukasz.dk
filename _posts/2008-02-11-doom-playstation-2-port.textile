"Cosmito":http://forums.ps2dev.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8970 has been doing a lot of addition work on my quick PS2 port of doom lately, "recently adding sound support":http://ps2homebrewing.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/ps2doom-with-proper-sound-at-last/. To keep updated on the latest PS2Doom changes, check Cosmitos "website":http://ps2homebrewing.wordpress.com/.

**Original post:**

"Doom by id Software":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28video_game%29 appears to available for every platform known to man, except for the PlayStation 2. So I wondered how long it would take to port it over to PS2 and the answer to that question turned out to be less than 3 hours. Using the PS2 port of SDL, gsKit (SDL requires it for video) and PS2SDK, all available from "PS2dev.org Subversion repository":http://svn.ps2dev.org and a SDL port of Doom "available here":http://www.libsdl.org/projects/doom/, I managed to get a very basic (read: hackish) port of Doom running on the PS2 without much effort.

I've only tested the port over PS2Link and it will most likely not run from a CD-R. There is no sound, however there is support for sound in PS2 SDL, but does not appear to work with Doom and I have not investigated the cause. Saving and loading of games works, as they just save to host/PC. The DualShock controls are as follow (USB keyboard and mouse are untested)

pre. Left Analog Stick : Move
Cross             : Enter
Square/R1         : CTRL / Fire
Circle/R2         : Space / Open doors
Triangle          : Escape
L1                : x
L2                : y
L1 and L2 are for entering savegame names

I will not continue to work on this port, it was just a quick nostalgic proof of concept port.

*Update 2:* 

A "PS2 port":http://firehead.org/~jessh/lsdldoom/  by "Jason Yu":http://www.jasonyu.net/ with sound effect support has "surfaced":http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?p=66358#66358. I've compiled the source into a single ELF with the DOOM shareware data included, which should run from CD-ROM, USB, etc (not tested). Included in the archive is also a "ps2-packer":http://ps2dev.org/ps2/Tools/Packers/Unpackers/PS2-Packer_0.4.4 compressed version of DOOM.ELF named DOOMP.ELF.
