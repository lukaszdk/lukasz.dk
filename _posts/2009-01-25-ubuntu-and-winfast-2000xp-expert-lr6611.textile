After a clean install of Ubuntu 8.10 my OEM TV tuner card called LR6611 (came with a AOpen XC Cube EA 65-II) was no longer working and I had forgotten how I made it work years ago. The cx88xx video4linux driver is correctly loaded, but the card is not detected.  S-video and video works in <a href="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/">tvtime</a> out of the box, but the quality is poor.

Below is the output from* lspci -vnn*
bq. 01:06.0 Multimedia video controller [0400]: Conexant Systems, Inc.
CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder [14f1:8800] (rev 05)
Subsystem: AOPEN Inc. Device [a0a0:6f05]
Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 17
Memory at e3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
Capabilities: <access denied>
Kernel driver in use: cx8800
Kernel modules: cx8800
After some searching I found some information on this card on the  <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/vfl/msg24737.html">video4linux-list</a>. Turns out that this card is a Leadtek Winfast 2000XP Expert OEM variant, which you can also conclude from searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=LR6611">'LR6611' in Google</a>.

I used the information from the video4linux-list to configure the card by the following line to */etc/modprobe.d/options*
bq. options cx88xx i2c_scan=1 card=5 tuner=38
Now the card will be correctly configured when booting Ubuntu. You can also test the card without rebooting, by entering the following commands in a shell.
bq. sudo rmmod cx8800
sudo rmmod cx88xx
sudo modprobe cx88xx
sudo modprobe cx8800
You can watch TV channels in tvtime now. When scanning for channels, do not worry about the "no signal" message, the scanner will eventually find the available channels.

S-video and video input quality has also greatly improved compared to the default cx88xx settings for this card.
