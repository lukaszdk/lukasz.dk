  I noticed on your MinGW Tutorial there is typo in the instructions for extracting the  contents of the mingw-packages-ps2dev archive into the MinGW directory. 
  
  "when asked if you wish to overwrite files which already exist, choose no to all"
  
  This should be 'yes to all', otherwise you cant access the ps2dev.org svn and only get invalid command errors when attempting to update ps2devsdk files.

  Hey Marty,
  
  From what I can gather of information, I dont think there is any real video decoding support, except for Nvidia's PureVideo (Windows only) which offloads decoding to the GPU.
  http://www.nvidia.com/page/purevideo.html
  
  The only reference for a similar Linux project I can find is XvMC, which currently supports MPEG2.

  I'm considering the same mobo for my mythbuntu box. Would anyone know if the 7100/630i chipset provides any decent acceleration - supported in linux - to help with decoding (mpeg2, h.264, etc)? I'm hoping e2200 cpu or lower is enough.
  (sorry for posting this here, but since I cannot find much info elsewhere, I thought I'd ask the gurus who have this mb fully working)

  Morgan: I have the "stock" Intel CPU fan for my 2.2 Ghz Core 2 Duo and I havn't noticed it getting being louder after the update.
  
  Have you tried the "Load optimized defaults" option in the BIOS? They suggest you do this after you update your BIOS on the Gigabyte website. Maybe this will load more correct settings for your setup.

  Hi,
  
  I just bought the GA-73PVM-S2H and trying to get the sound working.
  I followed the instructions on how to update the ALSA.
  When I come to the part of finding out which model of sound card I use I get an error, the file does not exist.
  
  anders@anders-desktop:~$ cat /proc/asound/card0/codec\#*
  cat: /proc/asound/card0/codec#*: Filen eller katalogen finns inte
  
  Do you know what I have done wrong?

  If you have one of those stupid, pointless EXEs for those BIOS updates, you can use unrar to pull it apart. sudo apt-get install unrar and then "unrar e" on the executable.
  
  And yes, 169.12 works fine.
  
  This whole thing is pretty ridiculous to get this to work. Envy installed over a hundred packages and I think I ended up with a new kernel (that won't survive an upgrade) out of the deal.
  
  But I thank you for writing up your experiences. It got me running.

  I couldnt edit the above post, but the .XML didnt show up as i wrote it, but i've included it in the rar so you can see it correct format.
  
  Also i forgot to mention the boot process takes about 25-30 secs to load up, but works great, thanks to your Mplus-Loader! :) This didnt work for me with the original RUNME.ELF
  
  And the file structure for the Mplus card is as i showed it above, i deleted all the other files as they arent needed, at least for me they arent. The only file i needed in the BAEXEC-SYSTEM is the osdmain.elf and this works in ALL my NTSC consoles. Figured i'd mention that if you wanted to get some of the space back, but backup the files, just incase!

  lukasz.... did you notice that when you load programs like Ulaunch and other home brew the DVDROM is disabled? In fact if you have this programs issue commands to the DVDROM then it will freeze the PS2.

  it seems Datel really want the DVDROM to be shutdown even on pressed discs.

  Im using a Lexar 128MB jumpdrive, incase you were wondering. :)  These were reported as being the most compatible with many apps for the ps2. Also SanDisk brand is a good choice too.

  hey i was wondering if you could use your loader to load something like uLaunch? I would love to be able to do something like that.... I know its kind of silly of me to care, because i have a phat ps2 that can use the independence exploit, but I also have a ps2 that is unable to read discs and at all... so by being able to load stuff from the memcard /usb without a chip or exploit cd would just be lots of fun.  I did just purchase the mem+ from codejunkies (they better send me the ntsc version)  also you might find this tutorial on how to install Linux on your PS2 useful using the cogswap.

  I tried uLaunchelf and it doesnt work from the RUNME.ELF or from the MPLUS-LOADER.ELF, just a black screen. I also tried a bunch of other homebrew apps and they also dont seem to want to run with either. :(
  
  
  Apps i tried:
  uLaunchelf
  Ps2OS
  HD Loader
  Pgen
  SNES Station
  SMS Media Player
  
  It was able to boot HDLoader, but hung at the splash screen. PS2OS also loaded, but hung at the module loading screen. At least i got a little further with the MPLUS-LOADER.ELF than i did with just the RUNME.ELF.
  
  I will try a different set of 'simplier' apps tomorow.

  ok, i couldnt sleep thinking about this and so i kept at it. I got ulaunchelf to finally load off a USB stick using the MemPlus card and heres how i got it to work:
  I renamed MPLUS-LOADER.ELF to RUNME.ELF &amp; replaced the one in the BESLES-00000 MP folder with that one.
  Save a copy of the original RUNME.ELF as you can boot it with uLaunchELF.
  Next i renamed an  ELF Loader from a few years ago (cant remember who wrote the app)
  to EXECUTE1.ELF and placed this on the USB stick along with ULAUNCHELF.ELF . I used the latest version 4.12
  
  Next i created a BOOT.XML file (  mass:ULAUNCHELF.ELF ) MC and USB are the only supported paths.
  i then created a BOOT folder and put the following in it:
  BOOT.XML
  icon.sys
  sys_boot.ico
  
  I then put the BOOT folder on the Mplus card's root.
  
  Heres the structure:
  
  Mplus MC:
  BAEXEC-SYSTEM/
  */osdmain.elf
  */icon.sys
  */mcp.ico
  BESLES-00000 MP/
  */RUNME.ELF
  */icon.sys
  */mcp.ico
  BOOT/
  */BOOT.XML
  *icon.sys
  */sys_boot.ico
  
  USB stick:
  EXECUTE1.ELF
  ULAUNCHELF.ELF
  RUNME.ELF  {original}
  You can put other .elfs on the usb stick and run them with ulaunchelf. Ive put all the files i used into a winrar file you can download here.

  Actually, it did annoy me a bit that the drive kept spinning if a disc was inserted, after Memory Plus manager was launched. So I tried to see if it was possible to stop it.
  
  Unfortunately the drive is in an unresponsive state, you can't initialize it and wait to become ready, as this never happens, so the PS2 just "hangs" waiting for the drive to become ready. None of the calls to drive (when initialized without waiting for it to become ready) appear to return correct values, except for the state, which is reported as busy, but this could just be a default value.
  
  Normally you can stop the drive by resetting the IOP, which hosts CD/DVD driver, however this does not appear to be the case, as I already do this in my loader and so does PS2Link, but the drive keeps spinning the disc even after the IOP is reset.
  
  The question is if this is intentional by Datel, considering the other "problems" with the card :-)
  
  It is still possible there is some way to reset the drive from this unresponsive state, however it might require detailed knowledge of how the CD/DVD driver works. Knowledge I don't currently have, so in order for me to find a way to reset the drive, I would have to experiment by trial and error, which is a time consuming process.
  
  I will probably try to find a solution at some point, however at the moment I have other commitments taking up my time, and this won't change for atleast another 3-4 months. So you shouldn't count on me providing a solution, unless someone can provide me with some detailed information which can lead to a possible solution, then I wouldn't mind spending a little time testing :-)

  I've seen the Free Vast thread at PSX-Scene.
  
  Reverse engineering PS2 security features is of no real interest to me. That said, it would be impressive if they can pull it off, however I won't be the one doing it :-)
  
  I'm really only interested in the Datel Memory Plus card because it makes it possible to load a development tool like PS2Link without modifying your PS2 hardware.
  
  The main reason I made the loader for Memory Plus card was to fix/improve the features of the built-in software, so people getting started with PS2 programming could overcome the limitations of the card quickly.
  
  I of course realize the card and loader can be used for other PS2 software as well, however it's not there my interest lies :-)

  I made a tutorial using your loaders to help others who wish to better themself in the PS2 community using the Memory Plus card, hope you dont mind me linking back here to your blog for the files.

  I don't mind you linking to the files, you can also just mirror them if you prefer.
  
  You might want to include a link to the source in your guide, since some one reading it might want to add features to the loaders, and knowing it's possible is always nice :-)

  As I mention in the post, the BEEXEC-SYSTEM and BAEXEC-SYSTEM directories are required in order to for the memory card to boot. The "BESLES-00000 MP" directory contains the the Datel memory manager, which you can replace.
  
  My loader just loads ELF's that the built-in ELF is unable to load, and is pretty useless without the Memory Plus and the pre-installed files.
  
  So the short answer is no, however I think you can copy the files from another Memory Plus card using the PS2 browser, if you know some one who owns one and you were also unlucky and got a blank card.

  Hi lukasz and all,
  I have an NTSC-J PS2 unit (SCPH-30000); it won't boot the Datel card. Is there a way like adding or renaming some folders in the card to allow it to boot the memory manager?
  
  thanks.

  True... but reseting the console while sitting in your easy chair would be nice... I too, rarely play games on the console more of a hobby.  This is why IGR would be nice to reboot the box and test another version of an ELF and such without having to push the reboot button on the console...

  I too had the exact same experience with Codejunkies sending me a blank 64MB card, returned it only to find out the runme.elf is in PAL format only.
  
  The 2 folders are for the different consoles for both PAL &amp; NTSC regions to auto boot the runme.elf. Your console will only use 1 of the files from only 1 of the folders to boot, but which one is the fun part of figuring out, so the others can be deleted and give more space back.
  
  I have made a bootable CD of the runme.elf and ran it off a modchip with NTSC mode to run it, as my region is NTSC.
  
  I believe this is a Memento copy-cat that Datel studied and havent figured out how to run it in NTSC format yet.
  
  I couldnt get anything to boot using the runme1 &amp; 2 filenames on either USB or even from the MC in the BESLES-00000 MP folder. Im guessing most of the .elfs i tried wont run due to the modules they load.
  
  I did copy all the files easy enough with uLaunchelf to a USB stick. I deleted all and copied them back with uLaunchelf and it still works ok.
  
  Also only FAT32 fromatted USB devices are supported, not FAT. I have a MaxDrive 16MB and it dont work, as it wont format to anything but FAT.
  
  I dont know if any of that is useful, but i figured i'd share what i experienced with the Memory Plus 64MB.

  Have anyone tested to see if this works on NTSC-J PS2's?
  
  If so, then it would be a really useful alternative for Unmodded NTSC-J PS2s. 
  
  Currently I only know that Swap Magic 3.6 Plus can boot into the uLaunch.elf and run homebrew, but if this also confirmed to work and is compatible with NTSC-J consoles, I'd buy one very soon.

  my amd64 box would also freeze with cpu scaling, especially when kernel governor would try to increase the frequency from 50% to 100% .
  
  that was around 2.6.22 or 2.6.21 i guess. perhaps this problem has been long fixed.

  I'm using 7.10 and 8.04 on various EPIA m10000 and EPIA C7 1000mhz. There being used as servers, and will randomly lock up or give very strange results when using and bash session.
  On investigating it appears that the clock is 'stuck' or 'looping'. The time stays within a narrow (prehaps) 3 second band and never moves beyond, unless I reboot. /var/log/syslog shows two consequative entires where time moves backward. Is is possible this was happening on your setup? I got other installations of Ubuntu on non VIA platforms that don't exhibit this problem.

  I also have a EN12000EG for few weeks now, but I still have stability issues.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  I have:\r\n\
  \r\n  - run memtest86 for hours\r\n\
  \r\n  - set the BIOS according to rararasputin's advices\r\n\
  \r\n  - kept the proc at 1200 MHz\r\n\
  \r\n  - tried 686 and 486 kernel\r\n\
  \r\n  - in text mode only (no X)\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  and all I get is a 1 to 20 hours uptime... and nothing on /var/log/* neither on serial console connected to kernel debug. At least the watchdog works :-S\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  (current step is a \"in RAM system\" with no disk at all, no result for now...)\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  I'm running a Debian Etchnhalf: kernel 2.6.24-486, with only a PATA disk. Could you please precise your configuration:\r\n\
  \r\n  - type of disk\r\n\
  \r\n  - kernel used\r\n\
  \r\n  - modules loaded\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  Thanx,\r\n\

  My disk is a Samsung Spinpoint HM250JI, which is a 250 GB SATA disk.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  As for the kernel I just update whenever a new kernel for Ubuntu is available and I havn't had any problems with any Ubuntu 8.04 kernels, my current kernel: Linux 2.6.24-20-generic i686 GNU/Linux.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  List of modules: http://lukasz.dk/files/en12000eg_modules.txt\r\n\
  \r\n\
  Since I wrote the post I've had an uptime of over 21 days at one point until I rebooted due to a kernel update :-)\r\n\
  \r\n\

  Hi Lukasz,\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  Thanx for the (very quick) answer !\r\n\
  \r\n\
  I suspected the PATA driver, and there is a significant difference between Debian Etchnhalf and Ubuntu Harper:\r\n\
  \r\n  Debian Etchnhalf: my PATA HDD was seen as /dev/hda (through IDE stack)\r\n\
  \r\n  Ubuntu Harper: the same PATA HDD is seen as /dev/sda (through SCSI stack)...\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  So, I stopped my long term test of \"just in RAM\" uptime (after 8h) to try a long term test of Ubuntu Harper.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  If this fail, I'll buy a SATA disk !\r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  \r\n\
  Thanx again,\r\n\
  \r\n\
  Sam\r\n\
  \r\n\
  PS: I was used to my previous EPIA 533Mhz with always more than 200 days uptime.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  PPS: for your information, concerning the temperatures: after several tests and measurements, I now assume that:\r\n\
  \r\n  - SYS = temp1-40\xC2\xB0C\r\n\
  \r\n  - CPU = temp2+40\xC2\xB0C\r\n\
  \r\n\
  (I think during BIOS update, VIA mixed the two offsets registers of the Windbond...)\r\n\

  Hi Lukasz,
  
  I'm glad to hear that frequency scaling is running for you too ! I'm running it for about two weeks now without freeze. I started test about frequency scaling  to reduce the system temperature.
  I would like to give you the heat reduction, but global weather conditions (in France) have changed significantly and the comparison is difficult.
  
  Sam.
  PS: Regarding my previous investigation regarding the PATA driver, after a week I gave up and installed a lightweight Ubuntu 8.04...

  Hi Lukasz,
  
  Thanks for the info above. I have a AOpen XCcube AV EA65 with the same TV card (I think). 
  
  I think your info got me any further, but still I ain't there yet. But I am actually using Ubuntu 9.04. Here I don't have the /etc/modprobe.d/options file, so I created one. But I got a warning that I had to rename the file to options.conf, when running modprobe (so modprobe IS using the file). So I changed the filename. But still no succes. I tried 'scan', Kaffeine and the tvtime you mentioned above. But nothing works.
  
  scan gives the most clear error:
  mythtvuser@mythtv-desktop:~$ scan /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/nl-All &gt; ~/.tzap/channels.conf
  scanning /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/nl-All
  using '/dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0' and '/dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0'
  main:2273: FATAL: failed to open '/dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0': 2 No such file or directory
  
  And tvtime gives a whole list of errors. Here are the first few lines:
  mythtvuser@mythtv-desktop:~$ tvtime
  Running tvtime 1.0.2.
  Reading configuration from /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml
  I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/home/mythtvuser/.tvtime/tvtime.xml"
  I/O error : Permission denied
  I/O error : Permission denied
  Cannot change owner of /home/mythtvuser/.tvtime/tvtime.xml: Permission denied.
  
      Cannot allocate enough off-screen video memory.  This may be fixed by:
  
        1. Closing or restarting large X applications.
        2. Lowering the input width of tvtime (--inputwidth parameter).
        3. Lowering your colour depth or highest configured resolution.
        4. Increasing the amount of video memory in your X config file
           (for example, if you are using the i810 XFree86 driver.)
  
      See http://tvtime.net/ for more information.
  
  Do you have any idea what I am missing?
  
  Regards,
  
  Alfons

  As you mention the /etc/modprobe.d/options needs to be renamed /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf in Ubuntu 9.04, which I am also currently using with the tvtuner without any problems.
  
  If I run the rmmod and modprobe commands in the order given in original post, I get the following output from dmesg. The blank line indicates the shift from the rmmod to the modprobe commands.
  
  http://lukasz.dk/files/lr6611-dmesg.txt
  
  Also here is a the output from lsmod, in case you might have some modules loaded which conflict with the cx88xx modules.
  
  http://lukasz.dk/files/lr6611-lsmod.txt
  
  This is the output I get when running tvtime from a shell.
  
  Running tvtime 1.0.2.
  Reading configuration from /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml
  Reading configuration from /home/lukasz/.tvtime/tvtime.xml
  
  Based on your I/O error output, it looks like you might have some user rights issues with the 'mythtvuser'.
  
  Hope this helps :-)

  Hi Lukasz,
  
  Finally it works! I installed Mythbuntu 9.10 and created the 'options' file as you mentioned above. And then my TV card worked instantly! Now I installed Ubuntu 9.10, created the options file again and still everything is OK. I re-installed Ubuntu, coz I prefer the Gnome interface.
  Maybe I had these problems half a year ago, because I didn't create the options file with sudo. I'm not sure if that was the problem, but it sounds plausible to me.
  
  One more remark:
  It's better to call the file 'options.conf', otherwise a warning is created that files in modprobe.d need a .conf extension for future use.

  Thanks! I have the same setup and this helped me.
  
  I couldn't get it working with the 1600x1200 on DVI. I don't know if there's anyway around the DVI monitor being the primary. But with that setup the max resolution I could get was 3200x1200.
  
  Seeing that was the only thing I had different was the DVI/VGA setup. I switched that and got 3840x1200 with linux automagically knowing my second monitor 1600 res.
  
  I also got the very latest drivers from ATI (9.3) which I say have a less buggy version of amdcccle.

  This site itself is a great service to help compile that big pile of information.
  Since the ps2forums where uploaded it already saved me a few times.
  Thank you very much lukasz and extends to anyone else that is or was involved in this.

If anyone knows how to get a hold of the person / people who run ps2dev.org, please let them know (if anyone knows who it is, I don't off hand...) that their are plenty of people who would pay hosting fees, be an admin, etc.

  I only have one word for this:
  Amazing!
  
  Thank you a lot for creating and maintaining theses mirrors, I will bookmark this page (as it hold all the links to the various mirrors) so whenever I need a pice of ps2dev I shall find it :-)
  
  Though, I hope ps2dev.org will be fully up again one day....
  or - as you already said - a sucessor site will be born.... IMHO dev'ers communities like us need sites like that....
  
  Thanks again.

  Hi
  
  The admin and owner of the ps2dev.org domain is David Ryan aka Oobles.
  
  I dont have any contact information for him, but I can see he has a Twitter account
  
  http://twitter.com/oobles
  
  He wrote about ps2dev.org downtime recently
  
  
  http://twitter.com/oobles/status/22400614892
  
  It would be great if someone could lend him a hand with maintaining the site.
